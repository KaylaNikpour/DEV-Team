      <h3>About Ordinal Wear</h3>
        <p>
          Ordinal Wear was founded in 2024 by....Good clothing isn't always easy to come across, which makes fast fashion appealing - after all. It tends to offer a wide range of sizes at 
          low costs. Plenty of people know that fast fashion is bad, but we found that there weren't a lot of resources out there telling exactly why it is at an easy-to-understand level 
          while showing their sources. We also sought to provide more alternatives to fast fashion outside of “just thrift your clothes” or “just shop at X store instead”, as some of us 
          don't have the money to shop at certain stores or have body shapes not often represented in thrift store stock
        <h4>Our Motivations for Tackling This Problem</h4>
        <p>
          1.We aim to shed light on these issues and inspire change in the way we approach clothing consumption.  
        </p>
        <p>
          2.Ordinal strives to find an alternative to the fast fashion cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.Every choice we make as consumers has an impact.
