      <h3>Q. What is fast fashion, and why does is suck so much?</h3>
        <p>
        Fast fashion is a term used to describe a part of the fashion industry where clothes are made <b>quickly and cheaply</b> to keep up 
        with the latest trends. Fast fashion has been praised for <span><span>‘democratizing’</span></span> by providing cheaper versions of clothing put 
        out by luxury brands, but fast fashion companies aren’t doing it out of the goodness of their hearts – fast fashion relies on 
        inspiration or just plain copying from other companies’ collections to make money off of the trends others are setting <a href="#details">[1]</a> When 
        the average person sees a piece of clothing they like from a luxury brand, and then see a similar piece on a fast fashion website 
        for much less, they’ll purchase it from the fast fashion site <a href="#details">[2]</a>.  
        </p>
      <h4>What makes fast fashion worse than regular fashion is a few things:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The clothes are designed to be thrown out or become unused as new trends take their place instead of being made to last <a href="#details">[2]</a>.</li>
            <li>As a result, clothing items are not good quality, generally only lasting about ten washes <a href="#details">[2]</a>.</li>
            <li>Since fast fashion uses the cheapest production methods they possibly can, these clothes are produced in developing countries 
              without strict environmental or labour laws – profits first, environmental and ethical concerns a distant second.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Speaking of considering things from an environmental or ethical lens, companies may conduct what’s called a life cycle analysis, or 
          LCA on their product. Simply put, an <span><span>LCA</span></span> is looking at the entire journey the product will take, from the start of how it is made to what happens
           after it’s thrown out. LCAs are popular when trying to figure out the environmental footprint of other items, but it’s harder to use for 
           fast fashion. The process of making the fabric is often spread across multiple different factories, and fast fashion only takes two to 
           three weeks to go from <span><span>being designed to being sold</span></span>. For a company, doing an LCA on each piece of clothing they release would turn those two to 
           three weeks into several months, which isn’t very practical from the manufacturer’s point of view <a href="#details">[3]</a>.

      <h3>Solid waste generation</h3>
        <p>
          You may think, “I donate all my clothes and don't contribute to waste generation”. If you do, that’s great!  Unfortunately, a 2007 study by 
          Luz Claudio found that only about 20% of clothing donated to thrift shops was bought or otherwise used. What happens to the other 80% clothes
          that aren’t sold, and those that don’t make it to a second-hand store at all?  
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the waste made by the fashion industry is just sent to the <span><span>landfill and either buried or burned</span></span>. The clothes that don’t make it to the 
          landfill are usually shipped to developing countries, but due to the sheer amount of it, some countries have actually put bans in place to stop 
          the import of ‘waste’ clothing as to protect their own domestic clothing industry <a href="#details">[4]</a>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Clothing waste doesn’t just come from consumers throwing their clothes out either. Fast fashion companies will produce way more pieces of 
          clothing than necessary and end up having to throw it away, recycle it, or get it out of their warehouses some other way.  For example, in 2018, 
          H&M had 4.3 billion US dollars worth of unsold clothing <a href="#details">[6: p. 7]</a>.

      <h3>Emissions, water use, and wastewater generation</h3>
    </div>
        <p>
          <span><span>Sustainability issues</span></span> start with the making of the fabric. By the time a fabric makes its way to a manufacturer it’s often unclear where the 
          \raw materials came from or how they were treated. Fabric type also plays a role, which we’ll expand on a little later. This first part, where 
          materials are turned into the fibers that will eventually make up fabrics, is the most energy demanding and carbon emitting part of the process <a href="#details">[4]</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The fashion industry produces around 10% of global CO2 emissions, is responsible for roughly 20% of industrial water pollution, and produces over 
          90 million tonnes of textile waste yearly <a href="#details">[4: p. 189]</a>.   
        </p>
      <h4>Carbon emissions come from three main sources</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Electricity generation for energy-intensive processes, like turning raw materials into fibers, spinning yarn, and heating water for dyeing.</li>
            <li>Creation of polyester fibers.</li>
            <li>Transport of materials during manufacturing (e.g. raw material is flown somewhere to be spun into yarn, yarn is flown somewhere to be dyed, and so on).</li>
          </ul>
      <h4>Water usage comes mainly from growing the fibers that are spun into yarn:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Cotton is a thirsty plant and uses lots of water to grow – around 20 000 L of water is used to make 1 kg of fabric! <a href="#details">[1: p. 2]</a></li>
            <li>Wool’s water use comes from water given to sheep; exact numbers for water use depends on if the wool was sourced from a factory farm or not </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <h4>Water waste comes from two main sources:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dyeing process – fabrics cannot take up all the dye.</li>
            <li>Oil production and refining (for polyester).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

    <h3>Other issues and making a change </h3>
    <p>
      Another issue with fast fashion is how it uses polyester as its main fabric. <span><span>Polyester</span></span> as a material is the same chemical that plastic water bottles 
      are made of, which means that it takes hundreds of years to decompose. It also contributes to our current microplastic problem by shedding microplastics 
      whenever it’s washed <a href="#details">[1]</a>. Avoiding fabrics that are made of polyester or have a very minimal blend of polyester is the best way to minimize the microplastic 
      risk and lower the amount of carbon produced by the clothing you buy.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of an item is <span><span>to wear it longer!</span></span> A 2021 study found that wearing a piece of clothing for longer was 
      the most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the item. That can mean wearing the item for longer ordonating it for someone else to wear. 
      Washing the clothing less often and in an efficient washing machine was the second most effective reduction method <a href="#details">[7]</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What we hope to do by telling you this is that your mindset might shift a little bit – fast fashion thrives off of people buying new, cheap, trendy clothes 
      instead of wearing their old clothes for longer. It’s worth asking yourself what you would want to wear if there was no pressure to be trendy, and invest 
      in some high-quality staple pieces that fit your style. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We also hope that you’ll check out our <span><span>mending/upcycling/sewing</span></span> section to learn about ways you can make your existing clothes last longer or enhance 
      your wardrobe without needing to buy new as often!
