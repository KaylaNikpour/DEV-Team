    <h2>What is upcycling?</h2>
    <p>Upcycling is the process of recycling something in a way that enhances its value; in our case, that means taking fabric or clothing and repurposing it into something that you’ll use. Simple examples of upcycling are cropping an old shirt or jacket that you don’t wear anymore, turning a pair of old ripped jeans into a tote bag, or turning fabric scraps into a quilt. Embroidering or adding patches to clothing to give it new life is also upcycling – it doesn’t have to involve a lot of cutting and sewing!

    <h2>Where do I get sewing patterns?</h2>
     <p>There are plenty of patterns on sites like Etsy, and fabric shops often have large books showcasing the patterns they have for sale - you can usually find old patterns at thrift stores too. If it’s up your alley, you could even learn pattern drafting and make your own patterns!
    </p>
    <p>If you don’t have a printer but have a Calgary Public Library card, you have $5 of printing credit a month that you can use to print your patterns at the library if you’re sourcing your patterns online.
